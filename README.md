Hi everyone, My name is Tanmay Singh Lodhi and I'm from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. I'm a Front end Developer and Graphic Designer.
I've worked with many good clients and had an internship at Growth Heads Digital and for the past 3 years, I've been spending a lot of time on my Graphic designing skills using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Currently, I'm focusing on my web-development and it's going pretty smooth.
Also if you need a logo send me a mail or message me on LinkedIn.
